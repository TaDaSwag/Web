From there, I worked my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. Currently I am a Senior Product Designer at Linktree leading design for the Linktree mobile app</p>

Not to mention, Seb was a design team lead, which means he managed a full team of both onshore and offshore designs reviewing and providing feedback on all of their designs...
